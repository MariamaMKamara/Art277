<h1>“Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19”</h1><br>

    <p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be
feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard
down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected.<br>
Dr. Cardona explains.<br>
</p><p>
“‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best
protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100%
protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being
exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”<br>
</p><h2>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others,
including other vaccinated people?</h2><br>
While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds
that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines.<br>
“The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may
not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data
and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.”<br>
